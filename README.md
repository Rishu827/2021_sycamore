## Introduction
<p> NP-completeness is a concept that applies to decision problems with variable input size, so that you can analyze the running time of an algorithm as that input size grows asymptotically.

<p> The general problem of solving Sudoku puzzles on $n^{2} × n^{2}$ grids of $n×n$ blocks is known to be NP-complete[1].

<p> We have modelled this probelm using Graph coloring problem.
